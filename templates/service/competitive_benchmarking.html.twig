                  Eurogroup Consulting provides Indonesia Competitive Benchmarking services to help organizations, investors, and government stakeholders evaluate Indonesia’s industrial performance, innovation capacity, and regional competitiveness within ASEAN.
               </p>
               <p>
                  As the largest economy in Southeast Asia, Indonesia continues to strengthen its position as a key manufacturing and investment hub. With major policy reforms under Vision Indonesia 2045 and the Omnibus Law on Job Creation, benchmarking Indonesia’s competitiveness across multiple sectors has become essential for understanding market potential, operational efficiency, and long-term sustainability.
               </p>
               <p>
                  Our Indonesia Competitive Benchmarking services combine deep market intelligence with robust analytical frameworks to assess performance across critical industries. The outcome supports both international investors benchmarking Indonesia against ASEAN peers and domestic companies seeking to elevate their competitiveness in local and export markets.

               <h4 class="text-lg lg:text-xl heading-4">
                  Manufacturing and Industrial Benchmarking
               </h4>
               <p>Indonesia’s manufacturing sector is expanding rapidly across automotive, chemicals, and consumer goods. We benchmark cost structures, production efficiency, and innovation adoption across industrial estates in Java, Sumatra, and Sulawesi.</p>
               <p>Our analysis compares Indonesia’s manufacturing performance against ASEAN peers such as Vietnam, Thailand, and Malaysia, helping organizations understand key advantages in labor availability, domestic market scale, and resource access. These insights enable manufacturers and policymakers to improve productivity and attract higher-value investments.</p>
               <h4 class="text-lg lg:text-xl heading-4">
                  Logistics and Supply Chain Benchmarking
               </h4>
               <p>With its archipelagic geography, logistics efficiency is a defining factor of Indonesia’s competitiveness. We benchmark port performance, transport costs, customs clearance times, and logistics infrastructure development.</p>
               <p>Our benchmarking highlights the impact of initiatives under the National Logistics Ecosystem (NLE) and assesses Indonesia’s connectivity improvements against regional peers. The findings support logistics operators and investors in optimizing transport networks and strengthening Indonesia’s role as a regional logistics gateway.</p>
               <h4 class="text-lg lg:text-xl heading-4">
                  Energy and Sustainability Benchmarking
               </h4>
               <p>Indonesia’s energy transition is accelerating through the National Energy Policy (KEN) and the Energy Transition Mechanism (ETM) framework. We benchmark energy cost competitiveness, renewable energy integration, and carbon intensity across industries.</p>
               <p>By comparing Indonesia’s progress in solar, geothermal, and bioenergy against ASEAN countries, we provide insights that support corporate sustainability and national decarbonization goals. Our benchmarking aligns with Kementerian ESDM (Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources) to ensure compliance and strategy alignment with Indonesia’s Net Zero 2060 target.</p>
               <h4 class="text-lg lg:text-xl heading-4">
                  Digital and Innovation Benchmarking
               </h4>
               <p>Indonesia’s digital economy is one of the largest and fastest-growing in Southeast Asia. We benchmark digital infrastructure, e-commerce penetration, and technology adoption across key industries such as fintech, logistics, and retail.</p>
               <p>Our analysis covers parameters like cloud usage, data management, and AI readiness, comparing Indonesia’s digital maturity against ASEAN peers. The benchmarking supports organizations in aligning with national initiatives under Making Indonesia 4.0 and Digital Indonesia Framework, driving competitiveness in the fourth industrial revolution.</p>

               <h4 class="text-lg lg:text-xl heading-4">
                  Healthcare and Consumer Market Benchmarking
               </h4>
               <p>Indonesia’s healthcare and consumer markets are expanding due to demographic growth and urbanization. We benchmark hospital capacity, pharmaceutical production, and healthcare access relative to ASEAN standards.</p>
               <p>In consumer markets, we assess spending patterns, brand competitiveness, and digital retail penetration. These insights help multinational and domestic companies refine strategies for market entry, product localization, and customer engagement within Indonesia’s dynamic consumer landscape.</p>

               <h4 class="text-lg lg:text-xl heading-4">
                  Construction and Infrastructure Benchmarking
               </h4>
               <p>As infrastructure development remains a cornerstone of Indonesia’s growth strategy, we benchmark project cost, delivery timelines, and productivity across major public and private projects.</p>
               <p>The assessment includes transport infrastructure, energy facilities, and industrial zone developments. By aligning with Public-Private Partnership (PPP) frameworks and national priorities under Bappenas, our benchmarking enables construction companies and investors to enhance delivery performance and regulatory compliance.</p>
