                    Why Strategic Planning is Essential
                    </h3>
                    <p>
                    Strategic planning transcends being a mere business activity; it
                    acts as the guiding beacon for your organization’s journey towards
                    realizing its vision. Here’s why it is crucial:
                    </p>
                    <ul class="space-y-1 list-['↘'] marker:text-picton-blue-500 marker:pr-5 [&_li]:ps-4 ml-4 marker:text-xl mt-8 lg:mt-16 mb-4">
                    <li> <strong>Alignment with National Development Goals:</strong> Indonesia’s
                        ambitious plans for economic growth and development set a framework
                        within which businesses operate. Strategic planning ensures your
                        initiatives are in sync with these national goals.
                    </li>
                    <li> <strong>Competitive Advantage:</strong> In Indonesia’s competitive
                        marketplace, having a clearly defined strategy serves as your edge.
                        It enables you to highlight and utilize your strengths, overcome
                        weaknesses, and set your business apart.
                    </li>
                    <li> <strong>Risk Management:</strong> Every business endeavor comes with
                        its set of risks. Through strategic planning, potential risks are
                        identified, and contingency plans are put in place, allowing you
                        to proceed with confidence.
                    </li>
                    <li> <strong>Efficient Use of Resources:</strong> With limited resources
                        at your disposal, strategic planning ensures that every asset is
                        optimally allocated, enhancing efficiency and reducing wastage.
